How to build<br>
This is built with **ccProj**. Before building this, please download **ccProj** first, and put uuAssistant at the same level of ccProj project. Then you can build it from ccProj2015.sln or just click ~Compile.bat and ~CompileDll.bat when downloaded build SDK from **ccProj**.<br>
# ccProj: <a href="https://github.com/uuware/ccProj">Link</a><br>
ccProj is a minimum C++ MFC. It is a framework for building Windows applications without 3rd run-time dll or libraries. The built release file has very small size and can run on Windows XP or even Windows NT, 98 or 95. I have maintained the project for more than 10 years and built a lot of free software with it.<br>
